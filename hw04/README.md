# HW04 - Grade Visualizer
> Woo Sik (Lewis) Kim - Stat 133, Fall 2017

In this assignment, we worked on a data set containing raw scores of fictitious students in a hypothetical Stat 133 course.

The main objective is to create a shiny app that visualizes: 1) the overall grade distribution, 2) the distribution and summary statistics of various scores, and 3) the relationships between pairs of scores.

To do this, we had to write a number of functions that helped us process the data, and compute the required statistics. In addition, we also had to write unit tests for the programmed functions.

**Special instructions for any user and/or graders:** 

To run the shiny app:

```R
library(shiny)

# Run an app from a subdirectory in the repo
runGitHub("stat133-hws-fall17", "lounotlew", subdir = "hw04/app")
```

**Comments and Reflections**

1) This was my first time writing unit tests for R; I have written them before for Python and Java.

2) 0; it was very clear and was not confusing at all.

3) Yes, this was my first time working with ggvis.

4) 1; using '%>%' was a little frustrating at first, but I got used to it quickly. Everything else was quite straight forward.

5) Yes, this was my first time working with conditional panels in shiny.

6) 2-3; I needed some YouTube videos and R Documentations to fully understand it.

7) I like ggvis the most, since it seems to be the most aesthetically pleasing to me.

8) Yes; anonymous students on Piazza, Omid (GSI), and Prof. Sanchez. There were also other sources such as Stack Overflow (previous questions unrelated to the HW).

9) This HW took about 6 hours in total to complete.

10) Getting used to Shiny and its interaction with ggvis was the most time-consuming.
